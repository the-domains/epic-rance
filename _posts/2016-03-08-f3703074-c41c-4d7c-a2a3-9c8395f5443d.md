I'm hoping that this doesn't choose red as the default BG color just because that's the accent color in this image.

I've spent a bit of time making some licensing contacts and we've successfully pushed this release to iTunes and Spotify!  I'll work on developing more distribution for our recordings as we move forward.

For now consider this a step in the right direction!
